Once upon a time, a rabbit had a race competition with a turtle.
The rabbit was more fast than the turtle.
Only after seconds, the turtle could not see the rabbit any more.

The rabbit sprinted ahead, without a doubt in his mind that he would win. He knew that he was appromiately 40 times faster than the turtle. However, the turtle had a plan. He had met with a hawk the day earlier and tipped him off that a snack would be headed down the road after the gunshot to start the race went off.
