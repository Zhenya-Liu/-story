Once upon a time, a rabbit had a race competition with a turtle.
The rabbit was more fast than the turtle.
Only after seconds, the turtle could not see the rabbit any more.

The rabbit sprinted ahead, without a doubt in his mind that he would win. He knew that he was appromiately 40 times faster than the turtle. However, the turtle had a plan. He had met with a hawk the day earlier and tipped him off that a snack would be headed down the road after the gunshot to start the race went off.

The rabbit was approaching the finish when he stopped to look for the turtle.
He knew that he was so far ahead of the turtle, so he began to laugh at and
taunt the turtle. But just as he was doing so, the hawk laid his eyes upon
the tasty looking rabbit. The hawk swooped down, aiming straight for him.

The wide-eyed rambunctious rabbit's heart thudded against his rib cage as for the first time in his fast life,
he was too slow. The hawk's talons gripped him and jetted away crossing the finish line. The turtle lost, but
the rabbit was never seen again.
